# Python Object Orientated Programming 🐍👩‍💻

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) katas . Each kata focuses on different aspects and concepts of OOP.

## How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the src folder to find the Python files containing my implementations for each kata.
Corresponding test files can be found in the test folder, showcasing the test cases I have used to validate the functionality of my code.

## Katas

### 1. Coder Class 🏫
In this kata, I created a coder class representing a coding student. The class includes properties such as name, location, course, and graduation_date. I also implemented methods like greet to interact with other students and alumni to determine if the student has graduated.

### 2. High Scores Leaderboard 🎮
For this kata, I developed a HighScoreTable class that maintains a list of high scores. The class allows adding and updating scores, calculating the average score, and identifying the highest and lowest scorers. The class also has a feature to reset the scores table.

### 3. Build a Ghost Class 👻
In this kata, I designed a Ghost class with properties like name, speed, and colour. The class includes methods to determine if a ghost is scared, change its state to scared, and modify its speed. I also extended the Ghost class to create instances for the iconic Ghost Gang from Pac-Man.

### 4. Object-Oriented Piracy 🏴‍☠️
For this kata, I created a Captain class representing a ship captain. The class includes properties like name, nickname, crew_size, and catchphrase. I also implemented a Ship class that interacts with the Captain class, allowing the calculation of whether a ship is worth plundering based on its draft and crew size.

### 5. Vectors 📊
In this kata, I developed a Vector class to perform vector operations. The class can add and subtract vectors, calculate the dot product, and check if two vectors are equal in length. The class enforces compatibility between vectors for these operations.

### 6. Banking App 🏦
For this kata, I created a User class representing a banking app user. The class manages the user's current balance and provides methods to deposit money, create savings pots, add funds to pots, transfer money to pots, and perform various interactions with the user's account.

### 7. Lift Simulation 🛗
In this kata, I designed a Lift class to simulate the behavior of an elevator. The class handles moving between floors, managing passenger weights, and restricting movement based on capacity and floor boundaries.

### 8. My New Robot 🤖
For this kata, I implemented a Robot class that represents a robot with various properties and capabilities. The class allows the robot to understand and process commands for moving, rotating, and interacting with its environment.

## CLI Mini App (Section Two)
Additionally, I created a CLI mini app based on the provided data. The app allows users to interact with NPCs, travel through rooms, use equipment, and engage in various adventure scenarios. Users can make choices and navigate through the story presented by the app.

Feel free to explore each kata's implementation and the CLI mini app to see how I approached and implemented various OOP concepts in Python!
